Supported data
==============

Brief sentence or two about the supported data structures and file types.

.. note::
    FluidSF expects data in NumPy arrays, so **ideally any file type that can be converted to NumPy arrays can be used with FluidSF**. If you are facing issues with a specific file type, feel free to `create a discussion post <https://github.com/cassidymwagner/fluidsf/discussions>`_ or `open an issue <https://github.com/cassidymwagner/fluidsf/issues>`_ on the FluidSF repository.
